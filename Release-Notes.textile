h2. 2009-10-30 - 1.2.2

*IMPORTANT* This release contains changes to the names of all css classes. All class names are now prefixed with "wc-". If you've written code that depends on class names, please refer to the stylesheet for the updated names. In many cases they're simply the same name as before with a prefix but some have changed in other ways where it made more sense.

    * Fixed inconsistent bug with dropping events in IE7/8 causing a js error
    * Updated the way that events that overlap are organised if using the overlapEventsSeperate option (thanks Yann)
    * Fixed bug where when resizing and overlapping events is enabled, the layout of overlapping of events wasn't being recalculated
    * Fixed bug where deleting existing or unsaved events that were overlapping was not recalcuating the layout of remaining events
    * Fixed bug where calendar was not honouring the allowCalEventOverlap = false option when creating new or updating events from dialog ( Issue 84 )
    * Added 'daysToShow' config option to optionally only display a limited number of days in a week. (thanks jura khrapunov)
    * Made change that prevents dragged events from being resized when the event has resizing disabled and overlapping is switched off. ( Issue 70 )
    * Added proper scoping of css to the calendar using 'wc' prefix for all class names.
    * Fixed problem with scrolling to hour if business hours are restricted

    * Added better overlapping event support with the ability to have staggered or parallel layout of overlapping events. (thanks Roderik)

    * Added better layout support for overlapping of events
    * Added ability to supply formatters for date and time
    * Added improved demo with creation / editing of events using jquery ui.

    * Fixed bug with IE7 resizing once an event gets to 2 timeslots or smaller
    * Added public method for returning an array of valid timeslots for a given date based on the calendar options. Useful for populating select fields with start and end times. 

h2. 2009-05-21 - 1.1.2

    * Fixed problem in safari and chrome where new events where not being created due to lack of event bubbling of mousedown and mouseup events. 

h2. 2009-05-17 - 1.1.1

    * Fixed problem with calculation of end date passed to data functions / url
    * Updating scrolling to hour to only occur on first render
    * Added code to check for changed options after loading data before actually re-rendering the calendar. 

h2. 2009-05-16 - 1.1

    * Extended the events data structure to allow options to be passed back to the calendar with event data. This has resulted in a config option name change. The events option is now called 'data'. The data option can be either an array of calendar events or an object containing a property called 'events' which is the events data array. The data option can also contain an additional property called 'options'. Any options passed with the data will replace the current options in the calendar and force a re-render of the calendar. This is very useful in cases where the calendar layout needs to change for different data sets. For example, a calendar that is delegated but each owner has their own preference for timeslots per hour.
    * Fixed problem where errors were raised due to missing mouseover / mouseout events on calEvents. 

h2. 2009-05-12 - 1.0

    * Added support for preventing overlapping calendar events
    * Internal refactoring and cleanup including moving standard events to use delegation
