h2. "Demo 1 (Basic)":http://robmonie.github.com/jquery-week-calendar/weekcalendar.html

Shows basic calendar functionality. Calendar Events are supplied as a local javascript array. All triggered events are displayed as messages, calendar events in the past are shaded gray using the eventRender callback.

h2. "Demo 2 (Multi data-source and dynamic config options)":http://robmonie.github.com/jquery-week-calendar/weekcalendar_demo_2.html

Allows you to select from two different data sources. These are both local javascript objects but could just as easily have come from a remote server. The data returned includes an ‘options’ property which overrides the default calendar options for ‘timeslotHeight’ and ‘timeslotsPerHour’.

h2. "Demo 3 (Create / update / delete using jquery UI)":http://robmonie.github.com/jquery-week-calendar/full_demo/weekcalendar_full_demo.html

This demo shows the use of jquery ui modal dialog for creating, updating and deleting events. It also demonstrates the use of
# Staggered overlapping events
# Querying the calendar for valid timeslots for a date to populate calendar event form select fields
# Limited display of timeslots based on business hours
